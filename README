At the first part of the exercise I used Hash set for the characters used as ascii chars at the Shell class.
The reason i chose a set is because there is neither a need nor a meaning for duplicated chars at the set.
I also used an array list int Shell class for the range of chars that the user wishes to add so i can comfortably
add it into the set of chars to convert with.
Next, at the BrightnessImgCharBMatcher class i used a hash map (cache) int order to optimize the program by
adding brightnesses that were already calculated to the map so that if called again there is no need to
recalculate.

1. The described problem is the leetcode 287 algorithm.
the run time complexity is O(n).

2. I created an array with the morse letter, than added each morse letter as value into a hash map with the
alphabetic letters as keys. Next, i added each morse combination to a set and returned the size of it so we know
how mant unique combinations there are. Run time complexity is O(s), s being the length of words length.
